Development instructions for TouchKit add-on

Coding convetions are the same as in core Vaadin.

Actual add-on  code lives in  vaadin-touchkit-agpl project. That is  also mainly
used  for development.  Integration test  apps are  in src/test/java  directory.
TestServer has  main method  that can  be run  during development  straight from
IDE. TestServer is embedded jetty that uses port 7777

Tests that  implement AbstractTouchKitTest  are listed automatically  on default
screen and  can be  started by their  name (e.g. fully  qualified class  name or
short name without com.vaadin.addon.touchkit.itest)

Essential maven targets that are needed during development:

mvn install // builds a snapshot release of the addon to your local repo
mvn gwt:compile // compiles widgetset for testing
mvn gwt:debug // starts gwt hosted mode and waits for remote debugger to be attached
mvn gwt:run-codeserver // starts "superdevmode" server

Automated    integration   tests    are    kept   in    a   separate    project:
vaadin-touchkit-integrationt-tests.  It builds  a  war file  and during  install
phase also executes interation  test scripts automatically. TestBench (WebDriver
based) is used to execute tests. See README in that project for more details.
