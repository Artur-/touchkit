	<h1>Vaadin TouchKit ${Implementation-Version}</h1>

	<p>
		<a href="https://vaadin.com/add-ons/touchkit">Vaadin TouchKit</a> is
		an add-on component for Vaadin to aid creating mobile web applications
		for touch based devices like smartphones and tablets.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note, that this Vaadin 7 compatible version is still under active
		development. Especially documentation and tutorial are not in their
		final shape. See <a
			href="http://dev.vaadin.com/svn/branches/vornitologist3/">vornitologist</a>
		and <a href="http://dev.vaadin.com/svn/branches/mobilemail3/">mobilemail</a>
		demos from SVN for up to date code examples. We also still have
		several bugs and performance issues to tackle. If you have tight
		schedule in your project, consider using the Vaadin 6 compatible 2.X
		branch at this point.
	</p>

	<p>Usage of modern build systems like Maven, that supports
		transient dependencies, is highly encouraged. Things should work fine
		with following dependency declaration and Vaadin Maven plugin:</p>

	<pre>
		
&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;com.vaadin.addon&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;vaadin-touchkit-${license.short.name}&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;${Implementation-Version}&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
			
	</pre>


	<h2>License</h2>
	<p>
		Vaadin TouchKit is a dual licensed product. See <a
			href="licensing.txt">licensing.txt</a> file for licensing details
		about the package you are using.
	</p>

	<h2>Manual</h2>

	<p>
		TouchKit manual is included as a chapter in the Book of Vaadin. The
		latest version can be found online at:<br /> <a
			href="https://vaadin.com/book">https://vaadin.com/book</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Tutorial (deprecated)</h2>

	<p>In addition to the reference manual there is a more tutorial
		like article available how to create a full featured mobile
		application with Vaadin TouchKit. The reader is expected to have basic
		knowledge of Vaadin development.</p>
	<p>
		<a href="tutorial/touchkit-tutorial.html">Read the tutorial</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Dependencies</h2>

	<p>This version of TouchKit is built against Vaadin
		${vaadin.version.maven}, but is expected to be forward compatible with
		minor versions. In addition to Vaadin, TouchKit depends some third
		party Apache 2 licensed Java libraries. Currently these libraries are
		only required during widgetset compilation. Those are automatically
		resolved for Maven users and also (others but core vaadin jars and
		their dependencies) are also collected to this packages lib directory.</p>
