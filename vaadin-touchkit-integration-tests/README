This project builds a war file of test apps in the main add-on project.

Sources are "stolen" from "../vaadin-touchkit-agpl/src/test/java so the
add-on project must be checked out next to this project.

During build integration-tests (with TestBench) are automatically 
executed towards tests. JUnit tests from classes with "ITCase" naming convetion
gets executed.

When developing TestBench tests it is easiest to run project in jetty with
maven target "jetty:run" and develop TestBench tests in an IDE. This ways one
can e.g. use "Run as-> JUnit test" in IDE, instead of running tests with
plain maven.

Tests are currently run with ChromeDriver.
